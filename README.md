# Arduino-Game-Template

This is a template to make games on the Arduino Uno Rev 3.

### You will need:

- An Arduino Uno Rev 3 (or any other interchangeable microcontroller)
- 1x breadboard for soldering board
- 6x Plunger Tactile Push Buttons
- 1x oled display
- 20x jumper cables male - male
- Power Supply (could connect to computer)

## Connections

On your breadboard start by placing 4 tactile buttons in a Up, Down, Left & Right manner. The buttons should not overlap into the same collum or this will cause connection issues later. This can be seen below.
